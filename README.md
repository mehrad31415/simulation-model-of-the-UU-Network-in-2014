# simulation-model-of-the-UU-Network-in-2014
This was the second project of the networks and communications course.

This was a simulation of the Utrecht University computer networks using Cisco packet tracer tool. First a map of the network connections was obtained. Then, a simulation of the Connections, Switches, Routers, PCs, DNS servers, HTTP servers, and email servers have been constructed. Experiments such as pinging, sending emails, working with the command lines of the simulation, opening browsers in the PCs of the simulation, etc. have been carried out.
